Exotic Mod - Unofficial Playable Clone

<br>

**Description:**

A working and playable version of Exotic Mod, for v7 of Mindustry.

Designed for the Serpulo campaign. (Not for Erekir, not yet anyway.)

WARNING: Not recommended for low-end devices.

<br>

**Important Background Information:**

Because the original Exotic-Mod is very seldom in a working and playable state, I decided to make this working and playable version of the mod.

This clone is basically a snapshot of an old version of the original Exotic Mod, which was then worked on, in order to make it playable.

The original Exotic-Mod was released under the GPLv3, and so is this clone of it.
